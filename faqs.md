### Do I need to provide identification?
Yes, you will need to present identification in order to proceed with any notarial services. Acceptable forms of identification include:
- California identification card or driver's license. Must be current or issued within the last 5 years.
- United States passport
- Inmate identification card issued by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (if inmate is in custody in California state prison), or inmate identification card issued by a sherrif's department (if inmate is in custody in a local detention facility)
- Consular identification document
- Driver's license issued by another state, or by a Canadian or Mexican public agency
- United States military identification card
- Employee identification card issued by an agency or office of the State of California
- Identification card issued by a federally recognized tribal government

Please note that any form of identification *must* include:
- A photograph of the individual
- Physical description of the individual
- Signature of the individual
- Serial or identifying number

If you are not able to furnish an identifying document, there are alternatives available involving witnesses. Please contact us for details.

### Do we need to meet in person? Can we use a video service instead?
We must meet in person to proceed. California does not yet allow for remote online notarization. (Though, there is a [bill](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1093) currently being considered by the state legislature that may change that!)

### Can you assist me in completing my documents?
Unfortunately, no. Our notaries public are not attorneys, and therefore unable to provide legal advice.

### Do I have to sign my document in front of you?
Not necessarily (it depends on the exact service you need), but it's generally safer to wait to sign until we meet. If you have already signed a document, and cannot obtain an unsigned copy to sign again in our presence, please contact us to see whether we can proceed.

### Which forms of payment do you accept?
We accept payment in cash or by credit card.
